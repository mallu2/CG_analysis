the iterator.py script analyses the trajectores of the dimer
Different iterator scripts are just made for different lengths of the protein.
monomer, for the monomeric DBD
full, for the full-length protein
coordinates.py analyses the trajectory coordinates either for a CG simulation or for a .pdb file.
geometry.py contains the class COoperations which returns the coordinates from the CG trajectory as floats. It can also return the COM of a region and other modified coordinates, the class MSD that calculates the mean square displacement for different tau values, the class geom which calculates Angles and distances.


plot_2.py can be used to plot all sorts of data from the analysis to quickly check the simulations. This has later been moved to the jupyter-notebooks.
