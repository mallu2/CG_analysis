The scripts in the Spiral package analyse CG trajectories and pdb files, focusing on specific regions of the simulated proteins, such as the recognition region H2 of the here simulated transcriptionfactor LacI.

The Ex_spiral1.py script calls functions from the Spiral package to perform the trajectory analysis. 

The Ex_MSD.py script can be used to analyse mean square displacement but this has been moved to jupyter-notebooks also.
